# Fury of the Ballin'
Inspired by HK Basketball memes. Creates a new charm,
Fury of the Ballin', which unlocked upon defeating Marmu
in Queen's Gardens. It costs 1 notch, and summons a clone
of Marmu to attack your enemies whenver you are at 1 HP.

I've made little-to-no changes to Marmu's UI, so although
she can't hurt you, her attacks are inconsistent and her
knockback means she can interrupt enemy attacks and even
knock enemies into you. Have fun ;)

## Changelog
1.0.1.0
- Reworked prefab code to be compatible with Marmalade mod
- Fixed bug where Marmu can deal massive damage to enemies
that don't trigger her bounce mechanic, such as the 
Radiance.
